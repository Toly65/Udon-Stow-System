this system makes managing and carrying around multiple items easier

to setup, simply drag and drop the attachment system prefab into your scene

pickups can have a "stow settings" script attached to their first child in order to allows for size limits on stow points

the stow points can also be placed on vehicles if necessary 

for more info / support here is the discord for my prefabs: https://discord.gg/cvF8JEhrq7
